CHIMERA CODEC -  This is an educational build of a hybrid video codec with major components built with great abstraction
allowing for incorporation of state-of-the-art video coding techniques alongside early generation components.
This is especially evident in the spatial coding loop that is currently using a subset of HEVC intraprediction modes.

Directions for Use
1. At the main folder of the of the project, right click and add the entire folder and subfolders to matlab path.
2. The original sequences, sample reconstructed and log files are in 'data' folder
3. Open cfg.m file to change the sequence and coding parameters
4. Run the codec from >>encoder/encoder_main.m
5. Example performance metrics and various works spaces can be accessed from the performance folder.
6. Utilities and tools are available in the common folder
